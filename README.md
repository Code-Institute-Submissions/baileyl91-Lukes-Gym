# Luke's Gym Website

View the [live project here](https://baileyl91.github.io/Lukes-Gym/index.html)

This project was created as part of my Milestone Project 1 
with Code Insitute Web Application Development course.

Have decided to create a website for a made-up gym to 
demonstrate what I have learned in the course so far.

### Design

**Color Scheme**

Have used two main colors in my website which are a dark navy blue for header and footers with an off white color for background and text.

**Typograpghy**

The main font I have used is the 'Roboto' for its clean minimal look, with sans-serif as a back up option if there was any problem with using the main font.

**Imagery**

I have chosen an image of the main area of the gym to display as a hero image to show the user what it looks like inside. Also have used images to show off equipment available in the gym as well as people having fun working out.
